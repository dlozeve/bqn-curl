* BQN HTTP library

FFI bindings to [[https://curl.se/libcurl/][libcurl]] for [[https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/][BQN]].

** Making requests

Only GET and POST requests are implemented at this time.

#+begin_src bqn
⟨Get,Post⟩←•Import"curl.bqn"
#+end_src

Simple GET requests:
#+begin_src bqn
r←Get"https://httpbin.org/get"
#+end_src

You can pass headers as a left argument:
#+begin_src bqn
r←⟨"Content-Type: application/json"⟩Get"https://httpbin.org/get"
#+end_src

Arguments, port number, etc, can be included in the URL.

For POST requests, pass data as an additional string parameter. It
will not be converted or encoded in any way.
#+begin_src bqn
r←⟨"Content-Type: application/json"⟩Post"https://httpbin.org/post"‿"{""key"": ""value""}"
#+end_src

** Response objects

The response object is a namespace with the following elements:
- ~code~: the response code.
- ~headers~: the response headers as a single string, separated by newlines.
- ~content~: the response content, as raw bytes.
- ~time~: the time the request took, in seconds.

If your endpoint returns text, you can use ~FromBytes~ from
[[https://github.com/mlochbaum/bqn-libs/blob/master/strings.bqn][bqn-libs/strings.bqn]] to decode UTF-8.
